# caffe_multilabel_image_classification
This repo contains the source code for a multilabel image classification problem on Kaggle. Two metrics are evaluated: [Subset Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs446-fa17) and [AUC](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs446-fa17b).  
The data we work on are fMRI brain maps which roughly reflect locations of brain activity corresponding to the task the subject was involved in i.e. a single map for each subject/activity.  
The more detailed description for these 2 competitions is [here](https://relate.cs.illinois.edu/course/cs446-fa17/page/project/).
